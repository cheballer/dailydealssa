# 🔧 Fixes Applied - User-Specific Cart, Admin Orders, Image Upload

## ✅ Issue 1: Cart Not User-Specific - FIXED

### Problem
- Cart was stored in `localStorage` with a single key `'cart'`
- All users shared the same cart
- When logging in with different users, cart count remained the same

### Solution
1. **Created CartContext** (`contexts/CartContext.tsx`)
   - User-specific cart keys: `cart_${userId}` or `cart_guest`
   - Proper cart management with add, remove, update, clear functions
   - Automatic localStorage sync
   - Session-aware (updates when user logs in/out)

2. **Updated Header Component**
   - Now uses user-specific cart key based on session
   - Cart count updates automatically when user changes

3. **Updated ProductCard Component**
   - Uses user-specific cart key when adding items
   - Cart persists across sessions for each user

### How It Works
```typescript
// Before (shared cart)
localStorage.setItem('cart', JSON.stringify(cart))

// After (user-specific cart)
const userId = session?.user?.id || 'guest'
const cartKey = `cart_${userId}`
localStorage.setItem(cartKey, JSON.stringify(cart))
```

### Result
✅ Each user now has their own separate cart
✅ Cart persists when user logs out and back in
✅ Guest users have a separate cart

## ✅ Issue 2: Admin Orders Page - 404 Error - FIXED

### Problem
- `/admin/orders` returned 404
- Could not view order history in admin panel

### Solution
**Created Admin Orders Page** (`app/admin/orders/page.tsx`)
- Full order management interface
- Displays all orders with:
  - Order number
  - Customer name and email
  - Number of items
  - Total amount
  - Order status (with color-coded badges)
  - Payment status (with color-coded badges)
  - Order date
  - View action button
- Search functionality (by order number, email, or name)
- Responsive table design
- Loading states
- Empty state handling

### Features
- ✅ View all orders
- ✅ Search orders
- ✅ Filter by status
- ✅ See customer details
- ✅ View order totals
- ✅ Status badges with colors

### Result
✅ Admin can now view all orders
✅ Search functionality works

## ✅ Issue 3: Image Upload Not Working - FIXED

### Problem
- Admin product form only had text input for image URL
- No drag-and-drop upload functionality
- Vercel Blob Storage was configured but not being used

### Solution
**Updated Admin Products Page** (`app/admin/products/page.tsx`)
- Replaced text input with `ImageUpload` component
- Now supports:
  - Drag and drop
  - Click to upload
  - Image preview
  - Upload progress
  - Error handling
  - File validation (type and size)

### Vercel Blob Storage Setup
The token is already configured in Vercel:
```
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=vercel_blob_rw_QOL5jHtE7B04ay7A_gVcZnOHFgG9mVNtOzklSHqx7m10Ve6
```

### How It Works
1. Admin drags/drops or selects an image
2. Image is uploaded to Vercel Blob Storage
3. Public URL is returned
4. URL is saved to product database record
5. Image displays in product listings

### Result
✅ Admins can now upload images directly
✅ No need to manually enter URLs
✅ Images stored securely in Vercel Blob
✅ Fast image loading
