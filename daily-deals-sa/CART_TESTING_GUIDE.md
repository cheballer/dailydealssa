# 🛒 Cart Testing Guide

## ✅ Cart Issue Fixed!

The cart was showing empty because it was trying to fetch product details from an API that didn't exist. I've fixed it to read directly from localStorage.

---

## 🧪 How to Test the Cart

### Step 1: Add Items to Cart

1. **Visit your homepage:** http://localhost:3000
2. **Click "Add to Cart"** on any product
3. **You should see:**
   - ✅ Toast notification: "Added to cart!"
   - ✅ Cart icon badge updates with count

### Step 2: View Cart

1. **Click the cart icon** in the header (top right)
2. **You should see:**
   - ✅ All items you added
   - ✅ Product images
   - ✅ Product names
   - ✅ Quantities
   - ✅ Prices
   - ✅ Subtotal, shipping, tax, and total

### Step 3: Update Quantities

1. **Click "+" or "-"** buttons on any item
2. **Cart should update instantly**
3. **Total should recalculate**

### Step 4: Remove Items

1. **Click "Remove"** button on any item
2. **Item should disappear from cart**
3. **Cart count should update**

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Before (Broken):
```typescript
// Tried to fetch product details from API
const response = await fetch(`/api/products/${item.id}`)
```

### After (Fixed):
```typescript
// Read directly from localStorage
const items = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('cart') || '[]')
```

## 📝 Cart Data Structure

The cart stores items in localStorage as:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "product-id-123",
    "name": "Wireless Earbuds Pro",
    "price": 799,
    "image": "/wireless-earbuds-black.jpg",
    "quantity": 2
  }
]
```

## 🎯 Cart Features

### ✅ What Works:

1. **Add to Cart** - From product cards
2. **Cart Count Badge** - Updates in real-time
3. **View Cart** - Click cart icon
4. **Update Quantities** - +/- buttons
5. **Remove Items** - Remove button
6. **Persistence** - Items stay in cart across page refreshes
7. **Empty Cart** - Shows "Your cart is empty" message
8. **Checkout** - Navigate to checkout page

### ⚠️ What's Not Implemented Yet:

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Cart Shows Empty

**Check:**
1. Is localStorage working? (Open console, type `localStorage.getItem('cart')`)
2. Are items being added? (Check console for errors)
3. Is the page refreshing? (Cart persists across refreshes)

**Fix:**
```javascript
// In browser console:
localStorage.setItem('cart', JSON.stringify([
  { id: 'test-1', name: 'Test Product', price: 100, image: '/placeholder.svg', quantity: 1 }
]))
// Refresh page
```

### Cart Count Not Updating

**Check:**
1. Is the event listener working?
2. Is the header component re-rendering?

**Fix:**
```javascript
// In browser console:
window.dispatchEvent(new Event('cartUpdated'))
```

### Items Not Persisting

**Check:**
1. Is localStorage enabled in browser?
2. Are you in incognito mode? (localStorage may be disabled)

**Fix:**
- Use normal browser mode (not incognito)
- Check browser settings for localStorage

## 📊 Cart Statistics

After testing, you can check cart stats:

```javascript
// In browser console:
const cart = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('cart') || '[]')
console.log('Total items:', cart.length)
console.log('Total quantity:', cart.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.quantity, 0))
console.log('Total value:', cart.reduce((sum, item) => sum + (item.price * item.quantity), 0))
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

Once cart is working:

2. **Add shipping info** - Fill out form
3. **Test payment** - (Will need to implement API)
4. **Test order creation** - (Will need to implement API)

---

## 📝 Notes

- Cart uses **localStorage** (client-side only)
- Cart is **per-browser** (not synced across devices)
- Cart is **per-user** (not synced across users)
- Cart persists **indefinitely** (until cleared)

---

**Your cart should now work perfectly!** 🎉
