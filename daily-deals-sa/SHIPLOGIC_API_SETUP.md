# 📦 Shiplogic API Setup - Step by Step

## 🎯 What You Need to Do

Based on the [Shiplogic API documentation](https://www.shiplogic.com/api-docs), you need to:

1. **Download the Postman collection**
2. **Get your API credentials**
3. **Test the API endpoints**
4. **Update the integration code**

## 📥 Step 1: Download Postman Collection

### **From Shiplogic Website:**

2. Click **"Download as Postman collection"**
3. Save the file (usually `shiplogic-api.postman_collection.json`)
4. Import into Postman

### **Import to Postman:**

1. Open Postman
2. Click **Import** button (top left)

## 🔑 Step 2: Get Your API Credentials

### **Contact Shiplogic:**

### **Ask for:**
1. ✅ API Key / Token
2. ✅ API Base URL
3. ✅ Authentication method
4. ✅ Environment (sandbox vs production)
5. ✅ Rate limits

---

## 🧪 Step 3: Test API in Postman

### **Setup Environment in Postman:**

1. Create new environment in Postman
2. Add variables:
   - `base_url`: Your API base URL
   - `api_key`: Your API key
   - `api_token`: Your API token (if different)

### **Test Create Shipment:**

1. Find "Create Shipment" endpoint in collection
2. Set environment variables
3. Fill in request body with test data
4. Click **Send**
5. Check response

### **Expected Response:**

Look for:
- Tracking number
- Shipment ID
- Status
- Estimated delivery date

---

## 📝 Step 4: Document the API Structure

After testing, document:

### **Request Format:**
```json
{
  "endpoint": "POST /api/shipments",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "body": {
    // What fields are required?
    // What is the structure?
  }
}
```

### **Response Format:**
```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "trackingNumber": "...",
  "status": "...",
  // What else is returned?
}
```

## 🔧 Step 5: Update Integration Code

Once you have the correct API structure, I'll update:

### **Files to Update:**
1. `lib/shiplogic.ts` - API service
2. `app/api/checkout/route.ts` - Checkout integration
3. Environment variables

### **What to Update:**
