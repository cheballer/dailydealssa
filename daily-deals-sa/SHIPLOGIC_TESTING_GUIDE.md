# 🔍 Shiplogic Integration Testing Guide

## ⚠️ Important Note

The Shiplogic API integration I created is **generic** and based on standard courier API patterns. The actual Shiplogic API endpoints and structure may be different. You need to verify the correct API structure with Shiplogic.

## 🧪 How to Test if Shiplogic is Working

### Step 1: Check Console Logs

When you place an order, check your browser console or server logs for:

**Success:**
```
📦 Creating Shiplogic shipment for order: ORD-123456
✅ Shiplogic shipment created: SL-ABC123
```

**Failure (Fallback):**
```
📦 Creating Shiplogic shipment for order: ORD-123456
❌ Shiplogic error, using fallback: [error details]
📦 Using mock shipping provider
```

---

### Step 2: Test Shiplogic API Directly

Create a test script to verify the API works:

```typescript
// test-shiplogic.ts
const API_KEY = '96f1b69f4a8646be8eb897218574437a';
const API_URL = 'https://api.shiplogic.com'; // This might be wrong!

async function testShiplogic() {
  try {
    console.log('Testing Shiplogic API...');
    
    const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}/v1/shipments`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        reference: 'TEST-ORDER-001',
        recipient: {
          name: 'Test User',
          email: 'test@example.com',
          phone: '+27 12 345 6789',
        },
        deliveryAddress: {
          street: '123 Test Street',
          city: 'Cape Town',
          province: 'Western Cape',
          postalCode: '8001',
          country: 'South Africa',
        },
        items: [
          {
            description: 'Test Product',
            quantity: 1,
            weight: 1,
          }
        ],
        totalValue: 100,
        currency: 'ZAR',
      }),
    });

    console.log('Response status:', response.status);
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log('Response data:', JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));
    
    if (response.ok) {
      console.log('✅ Shiplogic API is working!');
      console.log('Tracking Number:', data.trackingNumber);
    } else {
      console.log('❌ Shiplogic API error:', data);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('❌ Shiplogic API test failed:', error);
  }
}

testShiplogic();
```

Run this script to see what the actual API returns.

## 🔧 What You Need to Verify with Shiplogic

### 1. **Correct API Endpoint**

The current endpoint is:
```
https://api.shiplogic.com/v1/shipments
```

**Ask Shiplogic:**
- What is the correct base URL?
- What is the correct endpoint for creating shipments?
- What version of the API should I use?

### 2. **Correct API Key Format**

Current format:
```
Authorization: Bearer 96f1b69f4a8646be8eb897218574437a
```

**Ask Shiplogic:**
- Is this the correct authorization format?
- Should it be `Bearer` or something else?
- Is the API key correct?

### 3. **Correct Request Body Structure**

Current structure:
```json
{
  "reference": "order-number",
  "recipient": {
    "name": "...",
    "email": "...",
    "phone": "..."
  },
  "deliveryAddress": {
    "street": "...",
    "city": "...",
    "province": "...",
    "postalCode": "...",
    "country": "South Africa"
  },
  "items": [...],
  "totalValue": 100,
  "currency": "ZAR"
}
```

**Ask Shiplogic:**
- What fields are required?
- What is the correct field structure?
- Are there any required fields I'm missing?

### 4. **Correct Response Structure**

Expected response:
```json
{
  "trackingNumber": "SL-ABC123",
  "estimatedDelivery": "2025-01-15T00:00:00Z"
}
```

**Ask Shiplogic:**
- What does the response look like?
- Where is the tracking number in the response?
- Are there any other fields I need?

## 📞 Contact Shiplogic Support

To get the correct API information:

**Email:** support@shiplogic.com
**WhatsApp:** Available on their website
**Location:** Pretoria, South Africa

**Ask them for:**
1. ✅ API documentation
2. ✅ Correct API endpoints
3. ✅ Request/response examples
4. ✅ API key verification
5. ✅ Postman collection (if available)

---

## 🔄 Current Fallback Behavior

If Shiplogic fails, the system will:
1. ✅ Log the error
2. ✅ Use mock shipping provider
3. ✅ Create a fake tracking number
4. ✅ Order still completes successfully
5. ✅ Customer gets tracking info

This means **your orders will work** even if Shiplogic isn't configured correctly!

---

## 🧪 Test Your Current Setup

### Test 1: Place an Order

1. Add items to cart
2. Go to checkout
3. Complete payment
4. Check console logs for Shiplogic messages

### Test 2: Check Order in Database

```sql
-- Check if order has tracking number
SELECT 
  "orderNumber", 
  "trackingNumber", 
  "courierService" 
FROM "Order" 
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

### Test 3: Check Console Logs

Look for these messages:
- `📦 Creating Shiplogic shipment for order: ...`
- `✅ Shiplogic shipment created: ...` OR `❌ Shiplogic error, using fallback: ...`

---

## 🎯 What to Do Next

### Option 1: Get Correct Shiplogic API Info

1. Contact Shiplogic support
2. Get API documentation
3. Update `lib/shiplogic.ts` with correct endpoints
4. Test with real API

### Option 2: Use Mock Shipping (Temporary)

The system already has a mock shipping provider that works:
- ✅ Creates tracking numbers
- ✅ Orders complete successfully
- ✅ Customers get tracking info
- ⚠️ Not real courier service

### Option 3: Use Alternative Courier

Consider other courier services:
- **PostNet** - South African courier
- **Fastway** - South African courier
- **CourierGuy** - South African courier
- **The Courier Guy** - South African courier

## 📝 Summary

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Shiplogic service created
- ✅ Integration code written
- ✅ Fallback to mock shipping works
- ⚠️ Shiplogic API endpoints need verification
- ⚠️ May need to contact Shiplogic for correct API structure

**What Works:**
- ✅ Orders complete successfully
- ✅ Tracking numbers generated (mock)
- ✅ Customers get confirmation
- ✅ Admin can see orders

**What Needs Verification:**
- ⚠️ Shiplogic API endpoint URL
- ⚠️ Shiplogic API request format
- ⚠️ Shiplogic API response format
- ⚠️ Shiplogic API authentication

---

## 🚀 Quick Fix: Use Mock Shipping

If you want to test without Shiplogic, the system will automatically use mock shipping when Shiplogic fails. You'll get tracking numbers like:
- `TG-2025-ABC123`
- `TG-2025-XYZ789`

These are not real tracking numbers but allow you to test the full flow.
