## What's Been Implemented

‚úÖ Shiplogic service created (`lib/shiplogic.ts`)
‚úÖ Checkout integration updated
‚úÖ Webhook handler created
‚úÖ Fallback to mock shipping if Shiplogic fails
‚úÖ Automatic shipment creation on order

---

## How It Works

1. Customer places order
2. Payment processed (Yoco)
3. **Shiplogic creates shipment automatically**
4. Tracking number saved to order
5. Customer receives tracking info
6. Shiplogic handles delivery
7. Webhook updates order status

---

## Testing

The integration will automatically:
- Try to create shipment with Shiplogic
- If Shiplogic fails, use fallback mock shipping
- Log all actions to console
- Save tracking number to order

Check your console logs for:
- `üì¶ Creating Shiplogic shipment for order: ...`
- `‚úÖ Shiplogic shipment created: [tracking-number]`
- `‚ùå Shiplogic error, using fallback: ...` (if fails)
